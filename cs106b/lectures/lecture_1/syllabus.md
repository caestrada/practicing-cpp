# Syllabus

**CS106B Programming Abstractions** is the second course in our introductory programming sequence. The prerequisite CS106A establishes a solid foundation in programming methodology and problem-solving in Python. With that under your belt, CS106B will acquaint you with the C++ programming language and introduce advanced programming techniques such as recursion, algorithm analysis, data abstraction, explore classic data structures and algorithms, and give you practice applying these tools to solving complex problems.

We're excited to share this great material with you and have a superb team of section leaders that will support you through the challenges to come. We hope you will find the time worth your investment and that you enjoy your growing mastery of the art of programming!

## Learning Goals
After you’re finished with CS106B, we hope you’ll have achieved the following learning goals:

* I am excited to use programming to solve real-world problems I encounter outside class.
* I recognize and understand common abstractions in computer science.
* I can identify programmatic concepts present in everyday technologies because I understand how computers process and organize information.
* I can break down complex problems into smaller subproblems by applying my algorithmic reasoning and recursive problem-solving skills.
* I can evaluate design tradeoffs when creating data structures and algorithms or utilizing them to implement technological solutions.

We’ll also be giving you tools to tackle the following questions (note that these don’t have single right or wrong answers!):
1. What is possible with technology and code? What isn’t possible?
2. How can I use programming to solve problems that I otherwise would not be able to?
3. What makes for a “good” algorithm or data structure? Why?

## Lecture Schedule
While the below schedule is subject to change over the course of the quarter, we will cover the following topics (in approximate order):

1. C++ basics
2. Abstract data structures
3. Recursion
4. Classes and object-oriented programming
5. Memory management and implementation-level abstractions
6. Linked data structures
7. Advanced algorithms

## Textbook
Roberts, Eric. Programming Abstractions in C++. ISBN 978-0133454840.

You can either purchase a physical copy or use the course reader . Recommended readings for each lecture will be posted on our lecture schedule.

## Software
The official CS106 programming environment is Qt Creator, which is an editor bundled with C++ compiler and libraries. The software runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux. The Qt Installation Guide has instructions for installing the tools onto your computer.
