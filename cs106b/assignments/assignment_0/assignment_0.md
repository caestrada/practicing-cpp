# Assignment 0. Welcome to CS106B!

Welcome to CS106B! This assignment is designed to help you get your development environment set up and running so that you can compile, run, and debug programs. There isn't any actual programming involved, and we hope that this doesn't take you too much time to complete. Remember, you don't need to understand what the code you're being asked to run is actually doing just yet. Over the course of the quarter, each of the different parts of this program will be illuminated! This assignment must be completed **individually**.

## Step 1) Install Qt Creator
Your first task is to configure your computer for Qt Creator, the development environment that we'll be using in CS106B this quarter. Follow the instructions in the [Qt Installation Guide](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106b/qt/) for your operating system.

## Step 2) Download starter project
We will configure a starter project with the files needed for each assignment and post it in the form of a ZIP archive. Download the archive and unzip.

üì¶ [Starter code](./starter.zip)

## Step 3) Hash your name
Open the project in Qt Creator and build and run the program. It will ask you to enter your (preferred) first and last names. When you do, it will give back a hash code, a special number associated with your name. You can think of your hash code as a ‚Äúfingerprint‚Äù associated with your name that's unlikely to be the same as anyone else's fingerprint. Write this number down; you'll need it to complete the assignment!

## Step 4) Use the debugger
Open the [debugger tutorial](./DebuggerTutorial.pdf). This wonderful guide written by Keith Schwarz walks you through using the debugger on the Name Hash program. Follow along with the step-by-step instructions. At some point, you'll be asked to remember a number. **Write this number down**; you'll need it to complete the assignment!
