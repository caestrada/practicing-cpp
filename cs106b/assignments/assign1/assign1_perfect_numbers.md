# Assign1: Perfect numbers

This part of the assignment focuses on giving you practice with C++ expressions, control structures, and functions, as well as testing and debugging your code.

In addition, to writing code and tests in the **perfect.cpp** file, you will also be filling in answers to short answer questions in short_answer.txt (located under the "Other Files -> src" in the Qt Project View) as you work through this exercise. Make sure to answer all the questions (each one is `highlighted`, and labeled Q1, Q2, etc.). When filling out the short answer questions, we are more interested in seeing your reasoning and thought process than we are the "correct" answer. In fact, some of the questions may not even have a "correct" answer!

## Perfect Numbers

The first part of this exercise will be an exploration of a certain class of numbers called `perfect numbers`. So before we get started on the coding, we have a little bit of math and a little bit of history to go over!

A `perfect number` is an integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors. A number's proper divisors are all positive numbers that evenly divide it, excluding itself. The first perfect number is 6 because its proper divisors are **1**, **2**, and **3**, and **1 + 2 + 3 = 6**. The next perfect number is **28**, which equals the sum of its proper divisors: **1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14**.

Perfect numbers are a very interesting case study at the intersection of mathematics, number theory, history, and human fascination. While the exact origin of their study cannot be pinpointed, this class of numbers has fascinated mathematicians going back thousands of years and is perhaps one of the original examples of ongoing human fascination with the beauty of learning. The quote below shows just a taste of some of the philosophical reverence that has been afforded to perfect numbers throughout history.
