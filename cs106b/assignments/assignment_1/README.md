# Assignment 1. Getting Your C++ Legs

Here it is – the first programming assignment of the quarter! Completing this assignment will get you up and running with the C++ language and the tools used in CS106B. The work involves a mix of coding, testing, and debugging tasks. By the end of this assignment, you'll have fully gotten your C++ legs under you! (our apologies for the bad pun…)

The code you will write involves expressions, control structures, functions, and string processing. You have prior experience with these concepts, but the tricky part is figuring how to map what you already know to the strange new world of C++. The transition is what this assignment is all about. In addition to giving you practice with C++ syntax and libraries, the assignment will guide you through the tools and approaches you can use to test and debug your code. By the time you've completed it, you'll be a lot more comfortable working in C++ and will be ready to start building larger projects!

## Assignment parts

This assignment consists of two parts.

* [Perfect Numbers](./perfect-numbers.md)
is a fun warmup exercise involving number theory, algorithms, and optimization. It gives you a guided transition into C++, as well as the testing and debugging tools that we will be using in CS106B this quarter. You can start on this task right away – and we recommend doing so! Completing this warmup in the first few days reserves the better part of the week for the bigger second part.

* Soundex Search
is a complete program that demonstrates a nifty algorithm for matching and grouping names based on their pronunciation. This program uses C++ strings, console I/O, and the Vector class. Make sure that you have watched the lectures on strings and Vectors before starting on this part. There is a substantial chunk of code for you to write, so get an early start to give yourself sufficient time to work through issues and reach out for help (using the Ed forum, LaIR, and instructor office hours) if you hit any snags.
